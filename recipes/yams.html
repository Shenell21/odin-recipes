            <ol>
                <li>Wash and dry sweet potatoes and bake at 400 degrees Farenheit for one hour, or until soft to touch. Remove from

                <li>Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees Farenheit. While the potatoes are baking, combine remaining ingredients in a saucepan.
                    Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 30 to 45 minutes until sauce is slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick into a medium casserole dish. Pour syrup over them and return to the oven and bake for approximately
                    30 minutes.</li>
